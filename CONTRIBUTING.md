# Contributing Topics to the Show

## Submitting a Conference
Submit Upcoming Conferences to be talked about on the show using one our [conference issue templates](https://github.com/python-community-news/topics/issues/new/choose).

> NOTE: All Conference announcements should have an issue made. Issues will be closed and not reported on if they fail to meet the criteria for a valid conference, announcement type, or are not approved but the hosts.

### Types of Conferences
We would love you to submit any conference that would be of interest to the Python Community.

Here are some examples:

1. A Conference _celebrating Python in a geographic region or technical discipline ([PyCon US](https://pycon.us), [PyGotham](https://pygotham.org), [PyData](https://pydata.org/upcoming-events/))
2. The Conference **Celebrates a Community where Python is widely used** ([TableauCon](https://www.tableau.com/events/conference), [Open Data Science Conference](https://odsc.com))
3. The Conference is a General Technology Focus with a **Python/Data Science specific track** ([All Things Open](https://www.allthingsopen.org))
4. A community-run general technology conference ([!!Con](https://bangbangcon.com))

If there is any confusion, **we encourage you to submit it**. One of the maintainers will request more information in the issue comments if necessary.
